# Xgui4 OS Dotfiles

My dotfiles of my GNU/Linux System, including HyprArch (my hyprland setup) and i3wm and qtile config and terminal config and a work in progress installer.

## How to use

`scripts/installer.sh` : install the essential packages and a CLI helper to install the dotfile with Git Stow.
